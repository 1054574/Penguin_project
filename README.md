# Penguin_project
The downloaded zip should contain the following files; 
1. data_raw
2. data_clean
3. functions 
4. figures

Along with these, there is a main R script, referred to as penguin_analysisQ4 that includes all the necessary statistical tests and code to produce the resulting figures.  
The working directory has been set in the main R script using the code: setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path)).
